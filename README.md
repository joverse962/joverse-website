## 🔭 About The Project

**JOVERSE** serves as the central hub and documentation portfolio for a series of high-performance engineering projects. It is built to showcase work at the intersection of **embedded systems**, **computer vision**, and **autonomous robotics**.

The website itself is a modern, high-performance static site built with **Astro** and **React**, designed for speed and SEO optimization while delivering a rich, interactive user experience.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

The platform currently hosts documentation and media for the following core initiatives:

| Project | Stack | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[DRONE962](/drone962)** | `C++` `ESP32` `3D Design` | An autonomous 3-inch micro-drone powered by a custom flight controller written from scratch. Features mostly-printed components and custom PCB integration. |
| **[ESP-CSI-TUI-RS](/tui)** | `Rust` `TUI` `Real-time` | A Terminal User Interface (TUI) tool written in Rust for analyzing Channel State Information (CSI) data streams in real-time. |
| **[BLIND-CAM](/blind-cam)** | `Hardware` `Viz` `ESP32` | A handheld spectral visualizer that "sees" Wi-Fi signals. It renders the invisible electromagnetic spectrum using CSI data on a portable screen. |

## 💻 Web Architecture

This portfolio is engineered for performance using a modern "Islands Architecture" approach.

### ⚡ Tech Stack
* **Core Framework:** [Astro](https://astro.build/) (Static Site Generation)
* **UI Components:** [React](https://react.dev/) (Interactive Elements)
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
* **Deployment:** [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

### 🎨 Key Features
* **Sticky "Island" Header:** A custom React component that transitions from a floating island to a full-width bar on scroll.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** Heavy use of backdrop filters and semi-transparent borders (colors: *Woodsmoke*, *Cool Sky*, *Crail*).
* **Responsive Design:** Fully fluid layouts that adapt from mobile to ultra-wide desktop screens.
